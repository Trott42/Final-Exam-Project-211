/*
    chapter 18.3 (implement the greatest common using recursion)
    the gcd(m,n) can also be defined recursively as followed:

      * If m % n is 0, gcd(m, n) is n.
      * Otherwise, gcd(m, n) is gcd(n, m % n)

    Write a recursive method to find the GCD. Write a test program that prompts the
    user to enter two integers and displays their GCD.

    Big O notation:
    O(n) = Î˜(log(n))
